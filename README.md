# PoNW Burn Competition

The PoNWBurnCompetition dApp is a React front-end project, designed to communicate with the PoNWBurnContest smart contract. 

The dApp allows $PoNW holders to potentially win 50 billion free $PoNW tokens by being the wallet with the most $PoNW burned within a specific 12 hour window. 

Maximum contribution per wallet is 10 billion $PoNW, in order to keep as many winners as possible profitable in the event of a tie.
