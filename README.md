# PoNW Burn Competition

The PoNWBurnCompetition dApp is a React front-end project, designed to communicate with the PoNWBurnContest smart contract. The PoNWBurnCompetition will allow $PoNW holders to attempt to win 50 billion $PoNW tokens by being the wallet with the most $PoNW burned within a specific 12 hour window. The maximum contribution per wallet is 10 billion $PoNW, which is done in an effort to keep as many winners as possible profitable in the event of a tie.
